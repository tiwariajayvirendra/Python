# Statement: 2
# Given two lists, check if they are equal (same elements in the same order). If not, print which one is greater based on length.

# list1 =[1,4,8,9,7]
# list2 =[2,4,8,1,4,5]

#  Problem 4: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
# Statement:
# Take three numbers as input and print the largest one.

# Problem 5: Check if a List is Empty or Not
# Statement:
# Write a program that checks if a list is empty or not empty.
